# ginger-bread

Ginger bread is an old software I created in case my microphone would broke!
The idea of the app is to speech word with my voice, using a given string, based on a pre-recorded syllables.

This repository obviously doesn't contains my recordings, however, it can easily be used with any other person's voice.
